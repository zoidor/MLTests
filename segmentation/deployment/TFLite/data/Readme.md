If you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops, or by setting allow_custom_ops=True when calling tf.contrib.lite.TFLiteConverter(). Here is a list of operators for which  you will need custom implementations: ResizeNearestNeighbor.\nAborted (core dumped)\n'
